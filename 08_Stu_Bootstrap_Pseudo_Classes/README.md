# Pseudo-classes

- The objective for this activity is to customize Bootstrap pseudo-selectors.
- This involves overriding Bootstraps default pseudo-classes and writing your own CSS.

## Instructions

- Open [Unsolved/bootstrapPseudo.html](Unsolved/bootstrapPseudo.html) and [Unsolved/style.css](Unsolved/style.css) in your browser and VS Code.
- Notice there are currently no stylings on our Bootstrap `.btn` class.
- Override the `.btn` class in the external `style.css` file.
- Give your button a different `background`, `color`, `margin`, `padding` and `border` for each of the different states.
- When you are done, open your `bootstrapPseudo.html` file in your browser to see the changes.
- Take a screen shot and share it in Slack.
