# Button Override

- In this activity, you will practice overriding a basic button.
- This concept will translate into the bigger picture of customization when dealing with Bootstrap grids and components in later lessons.

## Instructions

  - You are going to create two styles, one inline and one external.
  - There currently are two buttons in `override.html`.
  - The first button, add the inline style directly into the element to change the `background-color`.
  - For the second button, create a class, then reference the class in `style.css` and override the `background-color`, `color`, `padding`, `margin` and `border`.
